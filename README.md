![Output](https://i.ibb.co/85KmDMm/Captura-de-tela-de-2020-01-02-13-20-49.png)

## Description

Simple matching detection algorithm with a clustering method knows as K-Means from OpenCV library, to select and classify rhizobia nodes in legumes roots. 

## Libraries

- OpenCV
- Numpy

## How to Use

Select the input image changing the value of the *img_rgb* variable in *main.py* file, also you should keep an eye open in the *template_image*
and *detection_threshold* variables, that controls the template image and detection threshold of match template function, respectively.
